# NLP-IASD-Toxic
NLP Project : Identify and classify toxic online comments

This project was done in collaboration with Ismail EL HADRAMI, Yassine ABOU HADID and Mehdi BENTALEB in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for the IASD master.

We've chosen to work on the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge to apply what we saw during the different lectures. The dataset consists of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits and the types of toxicity are:
   - toxic
   - severe_toxic
   - obscene
   - threat
   - insult
   - identity_hate

Our goal is to build a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate.
To solve this problem we've built different models using different techniques and we compared them to see which one achieved the better results.
